We have 3 main files, server.js, index.html, and main.js.
server.js hosts the web server that the html page will make requests to.
index.html is the main html page where the user can run the speed tests and see extra information.
main.js contains all of the javascript code that handles the ajax requests to the server, and calculates the appropriate speeds.

To run this a device must being running the server, then you can open up index.html and use the site.
node server.js //starts the server
