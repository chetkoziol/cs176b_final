We have 2 source code files. One is speed.html, which is the html page with all of the logic of the speed test.
The other is server.js, which hosts the html page. 
The server that we use to ping/download/uplaod files is here: https://internetspeedtest176b.wordpress.com/image-repository/

To run this, you have to have node and the necessary dependecies installed

node server.js //starts the server on port 3000 on your local IP
Then you can go to IP:port to view the page, and run the download/ping tests
